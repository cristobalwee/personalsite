# My personal website
Just a simple portfolio website I built to replace my old one at http://cristobalgrana.com/

## What I used:
The site is built with HTML and Sass, with Foundation for responsiveness. The frontend is written in angular and the animations are built with GSAP; I used grunt and compass for build automation.
